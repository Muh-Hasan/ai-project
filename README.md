# Tetris - AI Project

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play Tetris using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The agent learns optimal strategies for piece placement through reinforcement learning, with the goal of maximizing score and survival time. The implementation includes extended shape variations, real-time visualization, and customizable game parameters. The AI model is trained using experience replay and can be tested in both training and evaluation modes.
